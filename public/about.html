<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hi, I’m Laura! At 33, I’m embarking on an exciting new chapter in my life by diving into the world of web development. 
  After years of exploring different paths, I am discovering a passion for creating through code. 
  I’m thrilled to be learning the skills that will allow me to build beautiful, functional websites and applications. 
  This journey is both challenging and rewarding, and I’m eager to grow and contribute to the tech community.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me indulging in my love for video games, where I enjoy immersive storytelling and creative game design. 
  I’m also a proud cat lover—my feline friends are my constant companions and a great source of inspiration. 
  Creativity is a huge part of who I am, whether it’s through dancing, gaming, or exploring new ways to express myself.</p>

<p>I’m excited to combine my creativity, problem-solving skills, and newfound technical knowledge to craft meaningful digital experiences. 
 Let’s build something amazing together!</p>
